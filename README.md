Build a LSTM (long short term memory) model to analysis the positive or negative feedbacks from the restaurant coustomer'review. 
Data Cleaning: removing duplicate  and null value entries in the dataset

Build the Bidirectional LSTM Model: built a bidirectional LSTM model.This type of model is highlighted for its ability to capture patterns from both the beginning and the end of text sequences, 
providing a more comprehensive representation of the data for sentiment analysis.

Train the Model: use training dataset to train the Bidirectional LSTM model, indicating the practical steps taken to fit the model on the cleaned dataset.

Evaluating Model's Performance: After training, used the F1-Weighted score to validate the performance of this model on unseen dataset.

Saving Model: saving the model which I built and then I can download it for next time using.
